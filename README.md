Welcome to the GW-Cyber Website. 

GW Cyber is a student led technical organization at The George Washington University. 
Our focus is on educating the student body about the security of the entire systems stacks – from computer hardware, 
to networks, to software. The organization’s goal is to not only expose students to the vulnerabilities and applications
used to exploit information technology, but also to teach students how to better guard themselves against these attacks. 
GW Cyber is extremely unique, as it is the first entirely student-driven information system, cyber oriented club at GW. 
Our meetings generally consist of workshops, led by experienced, senior members. 
They also consist of occasional professional guest speakers, conferences, and events.

It is still currently in the development phase, but we hope to have it up and running as soon as possible.


Our current todo list includes:

1. Fix about us, eboard, events and contact us links. They are currently partially broken as a result of the index file's href's-
referring to them as if they are in the same folder. As well, the same needs to be done from these pages to reaccess the index file.
They are assuming that index is in the src folder as they are.

2. Change the images on home page. A red die and a scheduling meme do not portray the formal website design we are interested in.

3. Change the order of the cycling slides. It does not make sense to number them and have them start at the last slide. 

4. The "Events" page has no events. It is actually a duplicate of the "Eboard" page, but without the images.

5. The Contact Us page has an incorrect title based on a different organization.

6. We still require the logo that was supposedly being created for GW-Cyber.

7. Once all of this is done, the website should be styled. It needs consistent font size, and a GW Blue for the background
instead of the current dark red that it has.
