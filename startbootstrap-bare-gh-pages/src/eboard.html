<meta content="GW Cyber is a student led technical organization at The George Washington University. Our focus is on educating the student body about the security of the entire systems stacks – from computer hardware, to networks, to software. The organization’s goal is to not only expose students to the vulnerabilities and applications used to exploit information technology, but also to teach students how to better guard themselves against these attacks.GW Cyber is extremely unique, as it is the first entirely student-driven information system, cyber oriented club at GW. Our meetings generally consist of workshops, led by experienced, senior members. They also consist of occasional professional guest speakers, conferences, and events. If you're interested in defending yourself in a technologically driven world, talk to us!" name="description" />

        My name is Kyi Win. I am a second year graduate student studying Data Science. I enjoy creating data visualizations. I studied psychology when I was an undergraduate student. I joined GW cyber because I think knowing about cyber security will be very useful and knowledgable as I am studying data science, and wanted to get involved in a club while in school. During my internship last summer, I built dashboards with Tableau, and I can answer questions related to Tableau or how to use it if anyone is interested.</div>
